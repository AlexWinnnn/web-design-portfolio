      <h2>Brief Background</h2>
      <p>
        I am a junior at the University of Denver enrolled in the MFJS 3501: Web Design & Content Development course. I am learning the ins and outs of website creation through building website skeletons and turning them into accessible web pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        This course is my first experience working with code, specifically HTML, but I am excited to see the progression. I am a Journalism major who loves to the travel the world and hopes to write seven books, one on each continent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Creating this website is helping me better understand and appreciate the interconnectedness that website are, and this site is a basic example of my beginnings in that.

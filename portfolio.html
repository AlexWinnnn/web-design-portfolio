        This page will be where I showcase my prior coursework from not only MFJS 3501, but other classes where the work relates. There is nothing included right now as this is the skeleton, but I look forward to adding in later on.

        Although I have designed a website through WordPress prior to this course, I am now learning how to create and execute an effective website from the very first to the last step.

      <p>
        As the course progesses, I intend to continuously add to my portfolio in order to share more detailed depictions of my learning and academic journey.
